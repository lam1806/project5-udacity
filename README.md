The application should store Cart items, and each Cart item contains the following fields:

* `todoId` (string) - a unique id for an item
* `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
* `name` (string) - name of a Cart item (e.g. "Change a light bulb")
* `price` (string) - item should be completed
* `description` (string) - item should be completed
* `done` (boolean) - true if an item was completed, false otherwise
* `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a Cart item

You might also store an id of a user who created a Cartitem.
